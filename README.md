# California Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the California Housing Dataset. It demonstrates the application of various supervised learning models and includes thorough exploratory data analysis, model building, training, and evaluation.

### Key Objectives:
- Perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the factors affecting house prices.
- Build and evaluate different regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression) to predict house prices.
- Compare the models based on performance metrics and draw insights.

## Dataset
The California Housing Dataset, sourced from the 1990 California census, includes features like median income, house age, average rooms per household, and other relevant metrics. This dataset is publicly available through the `scikit-learn` library.

## Repository Structure
- `California_Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the project's analysis, model building, and evaluations.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies necessary to run the notebook.
- `data/`: Directory containing any additional data files used (if applicable).

## Setup and Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. To install the required packages, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
